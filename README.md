# Rock-Paper-Scissors (UI Version)

A simple **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game implemented in **JavaScript** with a graphical user interface.  
The game can be played directly in the browser and uses DOM manipulation to display moves and results.  

---

## Features
- User-friendly interface with **buttons and images** for selection.  
- Random computer choice generation.  
- Round results are displayed after each turn (draw, player wins, or computer wins).  
- The game automatically ends once **a player reaches 5 wins**.  
- A **Restart button** appears at the end of the game, allowing the player to start a new match (page reload).

## How It Works
1. The player chooses between:
   - **Scissors**  
   - **Rock**  
   - **Paper**  
2. The computer automatically makes a random choice.  
3. The round result is displayed on the page.  
4. The game continues until either the player or the computer scores **5 points**.  
5. A Restart button is shown at the end to start a new match.
